# Issues

Feel free to open issues of any type. No matter if support, questions or feature requests!

Note: There are maintainer issues that we create to keep track of things that we have to do.<br/>
If you find an issue by us that catches your eye, feel free to comment on it if you want to implement it.

## Developing

Setting up dev environments can be frustrating. Do not hesitate to contact us (see above).
